      <div class="p">
      <b>Short instructions</b>
      <i>Starting at the bus stop at the bottom of Shrigley Road, head up the hill. Keep following Shrigley Road as it heads through countryside
      and Pott Shrigley, before heading uphil past Shrigley hall hotel. Turn left into Long lane at the top of the hill, and follow Long Lane,
      eventually turning right into Besston Brow. Head down the Hill, rejoin Bollington at Palmerston street and head back to the starting point.</i>

        <b>Full instructions</b>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Start at the bus stop, and head up the hill along Shrigley Road.</b>
        <p><i>All of the ascent comes in the first half of this walk, so take it easy!</i></p>
        <li><b>Walk up Shrigley road, and continue along the road as the houses finish and you enter the countryside.</b>
        <p><i>The road quickly leaves the houses behind, and views of Blaze Hill and Harrop Wood open up to the right.</i></p>
        <li><b>Follow Shrigley road around to the left, remaining along the road as you pass through Pott Shrigley.</b>
        <p><i>You start to come across houses again as you head into Pott Shrigley, with the church and the school both prominent.
        Follow the road as it bends sharply to the left, or alternately walk through the church grounds and out a side gate to rejoin the road.</i></p>
        <li><b>Continue along Shrigley road to the brow of the hill, then turn left into Long Lane.</b>
        <p><i>As you head up the hill, you'll see the entrance to Shrigley Hall country hotel on your right.
        This has a cafe and restaurant, but factor in a reasonably long walk along the driveway if you want to visit.</i></p>
        <li><b>Head up the hill, then follow Long Lane gently downhill.</b>
        <p><i>After a short sharp climb, Long lane gently descends for approximately a mile,
        with stunning views of Alderley Edge, the Cheshire plains, and Wales on a clear day on the right.
        Although there is no footpath, it's rarely used by cars.</i></p>
        <li><b>Follow Beeston brow as it heads steeply downhill to the right, and then to the left.</b>
        <p><i>As you reach the end of Long lane, the road bends to the right and heads steeply downhill as ou rejoin civilisation.
        The road then heads down even more steeply to the left and becomes cobbled, and view of Bollington and White Nancy beyond open up.</i></p>
        <li><b>Join Palmerston street and follow it back to the start point.</b>
        <p><i>As you join the road, head uphill, cresting the brow of the hill and then heading back down to the roundabout
        to arrive at your starting point. There are several refuelling options available to you;
        you pass two bakeries and several cafes, pubs and restaurants on this last stretch â€“
        the fantastic Poachers Inn is just along Ingersley road from the bus station.</i></p>
